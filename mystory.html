				<p>The <strong>Psychedelic Diabetic</strong> is an alter ego of Zach Scanlon. <br>
					<br>
					That is who wrote what you're reading right now. Like all of us, I came to be who I am today because of myriad expriences-- but two of these expereinces, in combonation, are at the heart of who the Psychedlic Diabetic is. Firstly, what is up with the "Diabetic" part of the name. I was diagnosed with type one diabetes at age 13. This was a traumatic experience in part, if not solely because of the semantics of the word diabetes. When the physician came in to tell me what was going going on with me, he said you have diabetes but I heard "DIE-abetes". My 13 year old brain thought I died. At that moment my memory goes completely black. <br>
